## The Problem

### Fragmented Communication During Live Events

Event coordination currently relies on fragmented communication channels including phone calls, text messages, group chats, walkie-talkies, and printed schedules. When timeline changes occur during live events, coordinators struggle to update all stakeholders simultaneously, leading to missed cues, confused team members, and cascading delays. Studies show that 67% of event professionals cite communication breakdowns as the primary cause of event failures.

**Our Solution:** A unified real-time timeline platform that instantly syncs updates across all team members' devices with push notifications, ensuring everyone sees changes simultaneously.

### Inability to Adapt to Real-Time Changes

Traditional event schedules are static documents that become obsolete the moment something goes off-script. Event coordinators have no effective way to communicate timeline adjustments during live events, forcing them to rely on verbal communication that doesn't scale beyond small teams. This inflexibility causes stress, missed opportunities, and poor experiences for clients and attendees.

**Our Solution:** A dynamic timeline that can be updated in real-time by authorized coordinators, with all changes instantly visible to relevant team members and accompanied by contextual push notifications.

### Lack of Pre-Event Collaboration and Planning

Event teams currently use disconnected tools for planning (spreadsheets, email, project management software) that don't translate well to live event execution. There's no single source of truth that transitions from planning phase to execution phase, forcing teams to recreate schedules in different formats and increasing the risk of miscommunication.

**Our Solution:** A calendar-based planning system that allows teams to build and refine event timelines before the event, then seamlessly transition that same timeline into live execution mode with real-time updates.

## Differentiators

### Real-Time Synchronization for Event Execution

Unlike project management tools (Asana, Monday.com) that focus on long-term planning, Timeline is purpose-built for live event execution where seconds matter. We provide instant push notifications and live timeline updates specifically designed for the high-pressure, time-sensitive nature of live events. This results in zero-lag communication that keeps teams synchronized during critical moments.

### Role-Based Timeline Views

Unlike generic communication tools (Slack, WhatsApp groups), Timeline provides role-specific views where each team member sees exactly what's relevant to them while coordinators maintain full visibility. This reduces noise and cognitive load for service providers while giving coordinators complete control. This results in faster decision-making and reduced confusion during complex multi-stakeholder events.

### Seamless Planning-to-Execution Workflow

Unlike calendar tools (Google Calendar) or rundown software (OnCue, Shoflo) that separate planning from execution, Timeline provides a unified experience from initial planning through live event delivery. Teams build their timeline once and use the same tool throughout the entire event lifecycle. This results in reduced preparation time, fewer errors from manual transcription, and confidence that everyone is working from the same playbook.
